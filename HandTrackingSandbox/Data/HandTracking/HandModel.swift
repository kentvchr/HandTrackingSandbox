/// Represents a model of a hand in an augmented reality environment using ARKit.
///
/// This class manages the representation of a hand (either left or right) using ARKit's `HandAnchor` to track movement and orientation. It maintains a collection of `ModelEntity` objects, each corresponding to a joint in the hand skeleton.
///
/// - Properties:
///   - anchor: The current `HandAnchor` providing tracking data for the hand.
///   - chirality: Indicates whether the hand is left or right.
///   - entity: The root `Entity` that groups all joint entities.
///   - jointEntities: A dictionary mapping each joint name to a `ModelEntity`.
///
/// - Methods:
///   - init(_:): Initializes the hand model with a `HandAnchor`.
///   - update(_:): Updates the model based on new `HandAnchor` data. If the hand is no longer tracked, it clears all entities.
///   - clearAllEntities(): Removes all joint entities from their parent, effectively clearing the visual representation.
///

    /// This constructor sets up a HandModel with an anchor representing either the left or right hand.
    /// It initializes an empty entity to represent the hand in a scene and a dictionary to hold the joint entities.
    /// Each joint of the hand is then assigned a cube representation colored according to the hand's chirality.

    /// This method updates the model using new data from the ARKit `HandAnchor`. It performs several checks:
    /// - Confirms that the anchor is still being tracked and that the hand skeleton data is available.
    /// - Iterates through all joints in the hand skeleton.
    ///   - If a joint is no longer tracked, its associated entity is removed from the parent.
    ///   - If an entity for a joint doesn't currently have a parent, it is added to the root entity.
    ///   - The transformation matrix for each joint's entity is updated based on its new position and orientation relative to the anchor.
    ///
    /// Entities are cleared if the hand is no longer tracked or if skeleton data is unavailable.
